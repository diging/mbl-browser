This application is produced by the [ASU Digital Innovation Group](https://diging.asu.edu) and volunteer effort by [A Place Called Up Consulting LLC](http://www.aplacecalledup.com). 

Documentation is available here: https://diging.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MHDP

An Ansible role for Centos/RHEL is available here: https://github.com/diging/ansible-mbl-data-role

This application is still in early development. But the sky is the limit! Please submit bug reports and feature requests through the [MHDP JIRA project](https://diging.atlassian.net/projects/MHDP/summary) (you may need to log in).
